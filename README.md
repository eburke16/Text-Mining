# Text mining exercises in Python 

These are a sample of some of the Python assignments I completed at Columbia University and Johns Hopkins University.  
Topics include:

- Sentiment Analysis
- [Document Similarity Analysis](/blob/main/Document Similarity Analysis.ipynb)
- Named Entities
- Topic Modeling
- Text Summarization
- Complexity Analysis
- Dispersion Plots

Please reach out if I can help answer any questions about these topics or if I can help your organization employ similar tools.
