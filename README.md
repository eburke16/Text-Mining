# Text mining exercises in Python 

Examples of some of the Python assignments I completed at Johns Hopkins and Columbia University. Topics include:


- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Document Similarity Analysis (LSA)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entities
- Topic Modeling
- Text Summarization
- Complexity Analysis
- Dispersion Plots

Please reach out if I can help answer any questions about these topics or if I can help your organization employ similar tools.
